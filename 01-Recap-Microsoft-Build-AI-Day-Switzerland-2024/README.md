| 1.) Why hire people if you don’t give them AI assistant ? |
| 2.) Collaborate more inclusively. |
| 3.) Microsoft’s Core Area is  - Developer’s Productivity. |
| 4.) No system is intelligent than the data on which it is reasoned. |
| 5.) No AI Transformation is complete without security. |
| 6.) AI is creating more static fear rather than Kinetic moving fear. |
| 7.) Spending time on data is the best time we can invest. |
| 8.) AI with unstructured data is till a challenge. |
