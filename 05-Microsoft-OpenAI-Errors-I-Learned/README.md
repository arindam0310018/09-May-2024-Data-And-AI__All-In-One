Greetings my fellow Technology Advocates and Specialists.

This is the __Chapter #5__ of my __Data & AI__ Series which I started with __Microsoft Build AI Day, Switzerland, 2024.__

In this Session, I will provide my readers, the list of __Known Errors in Microsoft OpenAI.__ which I learned recently in AI Day, Switzerland.

| __Error #1:-__ |
| --------- |
| __HTTP Code 429__ |
| This means "Too many requests exceeding resource limits". The limitation can be because of CPU usage, Memory usage and maximum concurrent connections. |
