Greetings my fellow Technology Advocates and Specialists.

This is __Chapter #4__ of my __Data & AI__ Series based on __Microsoft Build AI Day, Switzerland, 2024.__

In this Session, I will provide readers, my views on __Readiness of Organisation for AI Adoption.__ 

| __READINESS OF ORGANISATION FOR AI ADOPTION:-__ |
| --------- |

| 1. Build the right team to bring the right motivation and productivity:- |
| --------- |
| This is the most important step but giving the benefit of doubt, it may happen that organizations are not clear on requirement or the right information from the source is lost into the translation from ear to ear. |
| Check the excerpt from Microsoft learn, DP-100 - __Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure.__ Here you will observe, how Microsoft defines __who should do what.__ This is just an example for ease of understanding. |
